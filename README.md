Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. 
1. RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
* Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
* Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
2. RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. 
3.RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. 
4.Typical RKE functions are: 
* Print lock â€“ (Blue switch on- All led on at the same time)
* Print unlock - (Blue switch press two times- All led off at the same time)
* Print alarm activation/deactivation - (Blue switch press three times- All led on in clockwise manner)
* Print approach light - (Blue switch press four times- All led on in anti-clockwise manner)
